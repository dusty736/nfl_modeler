"""
Current Week Router
-------------------
Utility endpoints for determining the current (season, week) context and
the latest completed week, globally or by team.

Base path: /api
Tags: ["current_week"]

Notes
-----
- 'Current' uses unplayed games (result IS NULL) to infer the next week.
- MIN(season) and MIN(week) are computed independently by design here.
  If multiple seasons with NULL results coexist, this may span seasons;
  we are NOT changing that logic todayâ€”just documenting it.
- Fallbacks for max-week endpoints default to 18 if no data exist.
