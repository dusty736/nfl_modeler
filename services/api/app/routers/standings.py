"""
Standings Router
----------------
Read-only FastAPI endpoints for team standings and simple DB liveness checks.

Base path: /api
Tags: ["standings"]

Environment:
- SEASON (int, default 2025): The season used to filter standings queries.

Notes:
- No functional changes beyond documentation and comments.
- Join type: currently INNER JOIN to season_results_tbl (requires a row for the given season).
  If you intended to show teams without a season row, you'd use LEFT JOIN instead; we are NOT changing it.
