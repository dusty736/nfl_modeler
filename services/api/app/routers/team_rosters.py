"""
Team Rosters Router
-------------------
Lookups for team rosters, position-group summaries, and weekly depth-chart starters.

Base path: /team_rosters
Tags: ["team_rosters"]

Notes
-----
- Response shapes: all endpoints return lists of mappings (converted to dicts for JSON).
- Case handling: team and position inputs are uppercased server-side.
- Errors: this router returns simple {"error": "..."} payloads instead of raising HTTP 4xx,
  by design to keep client handling consistent with existing code.
- No functional changes here â€” documentation and comments only.
